## Articulation Matrix

*Program Articulation Matrix is formed by the strength of the correlation of COs with POs and PSOs. The strength of correlation is indicated as 3 for substantial (high), 2 for moderate (medium) correlation, and 1 for slight (low) correlation.*

| CO/PO/PSO | PO1 | PO2 | PO3 | PO4 | PO5 | PO6 | PO7 | PO8 | PO9 | PO10 | PSO1 | PSO2 |
